          1. NOTE: When a donation house is transferred from one player to another (not purchased directly from Lsrcr with donation points), the house automatically becomes a non-donation house.
      15. **Trade any donation items other than donation points, jail cards, duel cards, or houses with other players**.
          1. Players with these points are permitted to sell or trade them for any reason (within the constraints of rule 2.1.8).

          1. attacking, handcuffing, searching, arresting, raping, or kidnapping.
      20. **Gambling and trade specific rules:**
          1. These rules only apply to players who do NOT have the [Lsrcr] tag. Tagged players should refrain from backing out of deals specific to rules 20.2 and 20.3.
          2. In cases where gambling (EG. /roll) has taken place, a player is free to back out regardless of the outcome of the bet. It is down to the players to honour the original deal and establish a mutual trust. This applies to donation items (such as points, jailcards etc.) and ingame cash.
          3. For **unofficial** events the same rule applies as 20.2, the player hosting the event enters into an agreement whereby a participant stands to gain. Note a participant is free to decide if they join events.   
          4. Where a trade has been agreed (EG donation points for in-game cash), a player can back out of a deal regardless of if they have the tag or not. No scam has taken place unless a player refuses to return items gained in a trade where the original deal has not been completed. For further information on scams see rule 16.

      2. **Make topics or post in topics that may insight hatred or flaming**. If something is wrong, make a report or private message an administrator, assistant senior administrator, senior administrator, or the head administrator.
      3. **Go off topic**. Go to "The Bar" if you want to be random. Being random does not include being bashful and hateful.
      4. **Bump old topics** unless you are adding something useful or interesting to the conversation.

            2. Tagging "@everyone" in "#general" to say "Come in game!" would not be appropriate.
            3. Tagging "@SAMP Staff" in "#support" to say "ID 32 ([Lsrcr]Energ) is using airbrake. There are no admins online." would be appropriate.


6. EXCEPTIONS to rules 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:

   1. Any Lsrcr administrator ranked level 4 and above is exempt from any rule that becomes necessary to violate in order to carry out administrative duties of Lsrcr as long as that duty falls within that administrator's assigned scope of duties.
      1. Some examples:
         1. An administrator may need to violate rule 1.1.8 in order to resolve a support ticket issue such as changing a player's email on their behalf. This would be an appropriate usage of this exception.
         2. If an administrator publicly posted a player's email address on the forum, this would not be an appropriate usage of this exception, and would be a flagrant violation of the server rules and players' trust.
         3. If an administrator were to deathmatch a player to further investigate one who they determine may be utilizing cheats, this would be an appropriate usage of this exception.
