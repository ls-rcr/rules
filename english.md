          1. NOTE: When a donation house is transferred from one player to another (not purchased directly from Lsrcr with donation points), the house automatically becomes a non-donation house.
      15. **Trade any donation items other than donation points, jail cards, duel cards, or houses with other players**.
          1. Players with these items are permitted to sell or trade them for any reason (within the constraints of rule 2.1.8).
          2. Players may not directly ask others to trade unless responding to a generic public enquiry made in the game's main chat or a post on the forums. This also includes direct enquiries for free donation items.

          1. Scammer does not have the [\Lsrcr\] tag.
          2. Scammer does not scam more than $300,000.
          3. Trade does not involve any donation items. This does not include a donated house.
          4. The victim of the scam has at least 500 score.
      17. **Ban evade**. You may not circumvent the ban system by creating another account and/or using a different IP address from the one that is banned.
      18. **Interrupt Pagati in the course of official roleplay**. You should not deliberately carry out any actions that could lead to disruption of officially announced (at the beginning of, every 5 minutes during, and at the end of roleplay) Pagati roleplaying activity. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
          1. attacking, handcuffing, searching, arresting, raping, or kidnapping.
      19. **Be a nuisance to staff**. Our staff are increasingly experiencing issues of players utilzing tools such as the private message system, administrator chat, and main chat to beg for things like group rights, donator items, administrator items, or other services that are not associated with administrative duties. While these instances of annoyance are already covered by other rules, we wanted to include this rule to specifically address the issue. If you are found in violation of this rule, you may be subject to an immediate ban.

3. # Lsrcr Forum-Specific Rules

   1. **You or your account(s) shall not--intentionally or unintentionally--do any of the following actions**:
      1. **Post support tickets or forum posts (like reports or unban appeals) in an attempt to expedite its review**. Admins know the reports are there, and they will get to them as soon as they can.
      2. **Make topics or post in topics that may insight hatred or flaming**. If something is wrong, make a report or private message an administrator, assistant senior administrator, senior administrator, or the head administrator.
      3. **Go off topic**. Go to "The Bar" if you want to be random. Being random does not include being bashful and hateful.
      4. **Bump old topics** unless you are adding something useful or interesting to the conversation.

4. # Lsrcr TeamSpeak-Specific Rules

   1. **You or your account(s) shall not--intentionally or unintentionally--do any of the following actions**:

      2. **Whisper spam** other users.

5. # Lsrcr Discord-Specific Rules

   2. **You or your account(s) shall not--intentionally or unintentionally--do any of the following actions**:
      1. **Spam tag other users/groups without a good reason**. If someone was recently tagged, do not tag them again unless necessary.
      2. **Tag "@everyone", "@here", or any other large group without good reason or justification**.
         1. For example:
            1. Tagging "@here" would be appropriate in the "#twitch-youtube" channel if advertising your current stream or a new YouTube video you uploaded.
            2. Tagging "@everyone" in "#general" to say "Come in game!" would not be appropriate.
            3. Tagging "@SAMP Staff" in "#support" to say "ID 32 ([Lsrcr]Energ) is using airbrake. There are no admins online." would be appropriate.


6. EXCEPTIONS to rules 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5:

   1. Any Lsrcr administrator ranked level 4 and above is exempt from any rule that becomes necessary to violate in order to carry out administrative duties of Lsrcr as long as that duty falls within that administrator's assigned scope of duties.
      1. Some examples:
         1. An administrator may need to violate rule 1.1.8 in order to resolve a support ticket issue such as changing a player's email on their behalf. This would be an appropriate usage of this exception.
         2. If an administrator publicly posted a player's email address on the forum, this would not be an appropriate usage of this exception, and would be a flagrant violation of the server rules and players' trust.
         3. If an administrator were to deathmatch a player to further investigate one who they determine may be utilizing cheats, this would be an appropriate usage of this exception.
